**Helsinki-Stockholm Ferry - seals**
The smiling white seal welcomed us onto the ferry heading to Stockholm from Helsinki. It was fluffy, standing on its tail next to a smiling member of the Silja Line crew. Genderless and silent, of course: seals don’t talk. I wondered if it was very hot for the person in that costume, but I didn’t ask. There was another seal swinging on a hoop above the ship’s promenade. That one was a stuffed toy, no person in it. There were similar stuffed white seals for sale in a shop in the Promenade. It’s the mascot of the ferry company.

A single seagull welcomed us to Stockholm the next day as we docked, along with a working dog, sniffing for something suspicious as the passengers walked passed it. Those dogs always seem to be distracted until they find what they’re looking for, at which point their laser focus is unmistakable.
